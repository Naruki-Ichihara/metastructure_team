Mechanics of materials learn the deformation of continuum materials under external loadings, including heat expansion, gravity, etc. Given this standpoint, we consider the relatively small length scale that we can ignore the inhomogeneously atomic scale structure. So we usually handle the material as the homogeneous continua. In contrast, the mechanics of structures focus on the assembly of struts made of continuum materials. Structures have many beams, plates, or rods, with various joints. These two mechanics are entirely different; however, the boundary of these mechanics has become a blur recently.

### Metamaterials

Metamaterials are an emerging class of matter. These materials are composed of numerous beams at a relatively small scale of the whole structure, often termed "lattice structure." The microstructure constructed by these beams enables various functions that cannot achieve by natural substances.

The state-of-the-art manufacturing process, including additive manufacturing or 3-D printing, endows materials with fantastic microscopic structures. So we can find an analogy with the semiconductor technologies such as the integrated circuit. In other words, we can incorporate diverse functions into the material with microscopic structures.

For example, the architected lattice metamaterial exhibits ultra toughness. Shaikeea's outstanding article shows that 3-D printed mechanical metamaterial, which consists of millions of unit cells, exhibits extremely toughness ([Shaikeea et al., Nat. Matter., 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-021-01182-1)). Another novel idea of mechanical metamaterials includes the "un-feel-ability cloak." Buckmann demonstrated an insensitivity to touch with the bump can using the architected lattice metamaterials ([Buckmann et al., Nat. Comm., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5130)). As these examples, metamaterials give structures with outstanding properties or completely new functionality. However, whether these metamaterials are materials or structures is unclear. However, whether these metamaterials are materials or structures is unclear. Suppose we define the **material** as something that can handle the homogeneous continua. In that case, the metamaterials are **material** in the observation at the length scale of the unit cell size.

### Metastructures

We define metastructures are the structures composed of metamaterials. Metastructures may consist of some kinds of metamaterials or standard materials. The critical point is that the metastructure includes some functional metamaterials in the system.
